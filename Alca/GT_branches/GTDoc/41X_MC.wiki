Alignment and calibration constants = 1, with no smearing.  Channels which are known will not be functioning at LHC startup are masked, as described [[BadChannelsForMC][here]]. | As !MC_311_V2 with the following updates:<br> - new Jet Energy Corrections (Jec10 v3). |
| [[%LINKTOGTLIST%/?GlobalTag=START41_V0][START41_V0]] | %GREEN%41X%ENDCOLOR% | As the 'MC' GT (including bad channels), but with realistic startup alignment and calibration constants. The mis-alignment and mis-calibration scenarios are described [[AlCaScenarios][here]] | As !START311_V2 with the following updates:<br> - new Jet Energy Corrections (Jec10 v3). |
