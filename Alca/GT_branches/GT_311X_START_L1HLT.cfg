Release = 311X > 3110pre4.
Scope = As the 'MC' GT (including bad channels), but with realistic startup alignment and calibration constants. The mis-alignment and mis-calibration scenarios are described [[AlCaScenarios][here]]
Changes = Add tag for 5E32 L1 menu and change the AlCaRecoTriggerBits in order to cope with the new 5E32 HLT menu
