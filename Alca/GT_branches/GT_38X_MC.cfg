Scope: Ideal/trivial conditions - perfectly aligned and calibrated detector. Alignment and calibration constants = 1, with no smearing.  Channels which are known will not be functioning at LHC startup are masked, as described [[BadChannelsForMC][here]].

Release: 38X > 380pre1.  For use with 1E31 HLT menu.
