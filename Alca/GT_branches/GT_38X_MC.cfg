Release = 38X >= 382patch2. For use with GRun !HLT menu.
Scope = Ideal/trivial conditions - perfectly aligned and calibrated detector. Alignment and calibration constants = 1, with no smearing.  Channels which are known will not be functioning at LHC startup are masked, as described [[BadChannelsForMC][here]].
Changes = Update L1RCTparameters to match configuration change.
